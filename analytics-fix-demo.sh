# Analytics Fix Demonstration Script
# This script demonstrates the analytics improvements made to fix the MongoDB aggregation issues

echo "========================================"
echo "Analytics Functionality Fix Demo"
echo "========================================"

echo
echo "Key Issues Fixed:"
echo "-----------------"

echo "1. Revenue Data Aggregation:"
echo "   - BEFORE: Counted zone IDs instead of event IDs"
echo "   - AFTER:  Properly counts unique events per month"
echo "   - Pipeline now includes lookup to zones to get eventId"

echo
echo "2. Event Type Revenue Calculation:"
echo "   - BEFORE: Incorrect field references and aggregation order"
echo "   - AFTER:  Proper date filtering followed by zone/event lookups"
echo "   - Now supports both specific event types and 'all' filter"

echo
echo "3. Top Events Calculation:"
echo "   - BEFORE: Oversimplified status logic"
echo "   - AFTER:  Enhanced with proper date-based status calculation"
echo "   - Added fallback method for reliability"

echo
echo "4. Error Handling:"
echo "   - BEFORE: Could crash on aggregation errors"
echo "   - AFTER:  Graceful error handling with empty result fallbacks"
echo "   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging"

echo
echo "========================================"
echo "Summary of Improvements"
echo "========================================"

echo
echo "✅ Fixed revenue data to count unique events instead of zones"
echo "✅ Improved event type revenue filtering with proper aggregation pipeline"
echo "✅ Enhanced top events calculation with better status logic"
echo "✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging"
echo "✅ Created fallback mechanisms for complex aggregations"
echo "✅ Improved data type handling for MongoDB aggregations"
echo "✅ Added comprehensive test coverage"

echo
echo "========================================"
echo "API Endpoints Fixed"
echo "========================================"

echo
echo "1. GET /api/v1/analytics/revenue-data?year=2024"
echo "   → Now correctly counts unique events per month"
echo
echo "2. GET /api/v1/analytics/event-type-revenue?year=2024&eventType=Concert"
echo "   → Properly filters by event category"
echo
echo "3. GET /api/v1/analytics/event-type-revenue?year=2024&eventType=all"
echo "   → Returns all event types when 'all' is specified"
echo
echo "4. GET /api/v1/analytics/top-events?year=2024"
echo "   → Shows top events with accurate revenue and status"

echo
echo "========================================"
echo "Analytics Fix Complete!"
echo "========================================"
echo
echo "The analytics functionality should now work correctly"
echo "with improved MongoDB aggregation pipelines that:"
echo "- Properly handle DBRef relationships"
echo "- Calculate accurate event counts and revenue"
echo "- Provide robust error handling"
echo "- Support all filtering options"
