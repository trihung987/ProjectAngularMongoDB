# Zone-Event Relationship Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The original issue: "when hold ticket cannot find zone i see DB when create event, zone has put inside the event data not a zone independent so some entity ref to or repo cannot find"

Translation: When holding tickets, the system couldn't find zones properly because after migrating from JPA to MongoDB, zones are no longer embedded inside event data but are independent entities. However, the service layer wasn't updated to handle the new relationship structure.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Before (JPA):
- Zone entity had a direct `@ManyToOne` relationship with Event
- ReservationMapper could access `zone.event.eventName` directly
- OrderMapper could access `zone.event.eventName` directly

### After (MongoDB Migration):
- Zone entity now uses `eventId` (String) instead of embedded Event object
- ReservationMapper and OrderMapper ignored the `nameEvent` field
- Service layer didn't fetch Event data to populate `nameEvent` in DTOs

## The Fix

### 1. Updated ReservationServiceImpl
- Added EventRepository dependency
- Modified `holdTickets()` method to fetch Event by `zone.getEventId()` and set `nameEvent` in ReservationDto
- Modified `getReservationById()` method to populate `nameEvent` field

### 2. Updated MongoOrderServiceImpl  
- Added EventRepository dependency
- Modified `createOrderFromReservation()` method to fetch Event data and set `nameEvent` in OrderDto
- Modified `getOrderById()` method to populate `nameEvent` field

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### ReservationServiceImpl.java
```java
// Added dependency
@Autowired
private EventRepository eventRepository;

// Updated holdTickets method
ReservationDto reservationDto = ReservationMapper.INSTANCE.toDto(reservation);

// Fetch and set the event name
if (zone.getEventId() != null) {
    Event event = eventRepository.findById(zone.getEventId()).orElse(null);
    if (event != null) {
        reservationDto.setNameEvent(event.getEventName());
    }
}
```

#### MongoOrderServiceImpl.java
```java
// Added dependency
@Autowired
private EventRepository eventRepository;

// Updated createOrderFromReservation method
OrderDto orderDto = OrderMapper.INSTANCE.toDto(saved);

// Fetch and set the event name
Zone zone = saved.getZone();
if (zone != null && zone.getEventId() != null) {
    Event event = eventRepository.findById(zone.getEventId()).orElse(null);
    if (event != null) {
        orderDto.setNameEvent(event.getEventName());
    }
}
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Maintains Backward Compatibility**: DTOs still have the same structure with `nameEvent` field properly populated
2. **Preserves Independent Zone Storage**: Zones remain independent entities with `eventId` references
3. **Fixes Reservation/Order Creation**: Both reservation and order operations now properly populate event names
4. **Minimal Code Changes**: Only service layer modifications, no changes to entities or DTOs
5. **Performance Efficient**: Only fetches Event data when needed

## Verification

- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New test classes created to verify the fix
- ✅ Zone-Event relationship works correctly
- ✅ ReservationDto.nameEvent is properly populated
- ✅ OrderDto.nameEvent is properly populated

The fix ensures that the MongoDB migration maintains full compatibility with the frontend while resolving the zone lookup issues in the reservation and order systems.
