# Fix for getOrdersPaged Issue

## Problem
The `getOrdersPaged` method in the OrderService was not returning any results due to issues in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

## Root Cause
The original implementation in `CustomOrderRepositoryImpl` used a complex MongoDB aggregation pipeline with:
- Complex DBRef field access (`zone.$id`, `owner.$id`)
- Multiple lookup operations that could fail silently
- Unwind operations that would cause empty results if lookups failed
- No error handling or fallback mechanisms

## Solution
Simplified the approach by:

1. **Replaced complex aggregation with reliable Spring Data MongoDB queries**
   - Used `mongoTemplate.find()` with simple criteria queries
   - Leveraged Spring Data MongoDB's built-in DBRef handling

2. **Added comprehensive logging**
   - Debug logging in service and repository layers
   - Error tracking for troubleshooting

3. **Implemented robust fallback mechanisms**
   - Multiple layers of fallback for query failures
   - Graceful error handling

4. **Manual DTO conversion**
   - Reliable conversion from Order entities to OrderDto
   - Proper handling of related Zone and Event data

## Technical Changes

### CustomOrderRepositoryImpl.java
- Simplified `findOrderDtosByOwner()` method
- Added manual query approach with proper error handling
- Implemented fallback mechanisms

### MongoOrderServiceImpl.java  
- Added comprehensive logging to `getOrdersPaged()`
- Enhanced error handling and debugging

## Testing
- Added unit tests for both service and repository layers
- All tests pass successfully
- Code compiles without errors

## Usage
The API endpoint `/api/v1/orders` now works correctly:
```
GET /api/v1/orders?page=0&size=10&sortBy=createdAt&sortDirection=DESC
```

This will return a proper `OrderPageResponse` with the user's orders.
